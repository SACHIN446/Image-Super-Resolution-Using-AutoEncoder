# Image-Super-Resolution-Using-AutoEncoder
This Project deals with Generating high quality image from the existing one wihtout changing image resolution

## Introduction
Traditional method for image enchancement were interpolation techinques which might use Linear, Bicubic, Nearest Neighbour methods.
When Deep Neural Network is used to learn the pattern and reconstruct the same image, the results were better than traditional method still there are some error because of less training short dataset.
Although the advantage of this project is, it is not going to change image resolution (or increase) but give us better result than original one.
